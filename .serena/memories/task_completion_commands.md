# Task Completion Commands

After completing any code changes, run these commands in sequence:

1. `bun run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
2. `bun run format` - Format the code
3. `bun run build` - Ensure the project builds successfully
4. `bun run check:ci` - Run final checks for CI

If there are any errors in these steps, fix them before considering the task complete.
